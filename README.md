# ConstructionProjectManagement

This MVC C# application was created for a construction company with the purpose of managing their projects.
It is to replace their use of Microsoft Project Scheduler with a more efficient way of sending only the necessary
information to specified company employees.

The app includes user roles and authentication.  It allows one to create and update tasks, projects, companies, and
company users' contact info.  It has email and text functionality to send updated tasks to specified company users.

-- You will have to go into the Notify Controller and provide your email info if you want to have emailing and texting ability.
-- There are comments to aid you with that.
